**Description:** This project employs visualizations, including AI-driven smart narratives, scatter plots, and bar charts, to offer insights into the evolution of technology sales over time. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, presenting coherent time-series data on sales across different regions in the United States. To examine individual regions, users can utilize the slicers located at the top of each page.

The analysis delves into product and customer dynamics across multiple pages, incorporating pie charts and tabular data matrices. These visual representations illustrate a positive upward trend in sales from the beginning to the end of the year.

Additionally, the project conducts a detailed examination of purchasing patterns, distinguishing between new and returning customers, with a specific emphasis on repeat purchases occurring within 30 and 60 consecutive days.

Lastly, the focus shifts to category sales, exploring their contribution to profit and trends in units sold. The analysis also considers the impact of discounts on profit margins.
