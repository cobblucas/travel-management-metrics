**Description:** This project employs visualizations, including AI-driven smart narratives, pie charts, and bar graphs, to offer insights into the evolution of corporate travel over time. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, presenting coherent time-series data on travel to customer locations across the world. To examine individual regions, users can utilize the slicers located towards the top of each page.

The analysis delves into customer retention and insights across multiple pages, incorporating pie charts and tabular data matrices. These visual representations illustrate a positive upward trend in retention.

Additionally, the project conducts a detailed examination of purchasing patterns, distinguishing between return rate and repeat customers, with a specific emphasis on repeat purchases occurring across age group and reservation type.

Lastly, the focus shifts to bookings, exploring their contribution to profit and trends in total bookings. The analysis also considers purchases by month to validate seasonality.
